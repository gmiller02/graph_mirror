/**
 * 
 * Your implementation of decorations. All methods must run in O(1) time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This program makes heavy use of the decorator pattern. It is
 * absolutely essential that you understand this design pattern before you start
 * coding. In previous programs, like Heap, you were allowed to modify your
 * Position classes when you wanted that class to store an additional piece of
 * information. However, when you want to potentially store a lot of things in
 * your classes, and especially when you do not know in advance what you will be
 * storing, the decorator's usefulness is profound.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Think of the decorator pattern like a post-it
 * note. You write what you want on it, then stick it on the class. Later on,
 * when you want to retrieve that information, you just retrieve the note, and
 * read what it has to say. Please refer to the handout for more details on the
 * decorator pattern and some examples on its usage.
 * </p>
