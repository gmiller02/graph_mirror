Design Choices: I made a major design choice in the PageRank part of my graph. I liked working with decorators a lot in
my Prim-Jarnik algorithm, so I decided to continue to use it in my PageRank because using decorators makes more sense to
me while working with a graph.
In my Prim Jarnik, I was heavily inspired by the lecture psuedocode and created three decorators to use. One decorator,
dist, keeps track of the cost of all of my verticies. The second decorator, prev, keeps track of the changes that are
made in the algorithem, because when we update one vertex, all of the previous ones are affected. The third decorator,
entry, helps keep track of the entries in the PriorityQueue that are associated with each vertex.

The PJ decorator method worked so well for me that I decided to adapt the PageRank algorithm to use decorators instead
of an Arraylist. To do that, I created two decorators. The first one, rank, keeps track of the current
