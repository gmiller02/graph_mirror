/**
 * This class defines a Graph that tracks its edges through the use of an
 * adjacency matrix. Please review the lecture slides and the book before
 * attempting to write this program. An adjacency matrix consists of a 2D array
 * of Vertices, with each vertex of the graph appearing in both dimensions.
 *
 * Since we are using an adjacency matrix, each vertex must have a 'number', so
 * that it can represent an index in one of the dimensional arrays. This
 * assignment is not as trivial as it may appear. Remember that your arrays have
 * a maximum index. Thus, you cannot just up the number for each vertex. Why
 * not? Think about what happens when you constantly add and delete new
 * vertices. You will soon exceed the size of your adjacency matrix array. Note
 * further that this number must be unique.
 * 
 * Make sure your AdjacencyMatrixGraph can be both directed and undirected!
 *
 * Good luck, and as always, start early, start today, start yesterday!
